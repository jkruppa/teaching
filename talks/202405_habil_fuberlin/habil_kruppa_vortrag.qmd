## The null ritual

![](img/null_ritual.jpg){fig-align="center" width=70%}

# Again --- why?

## The one formula *to rule them all* 

$$
T_{D} = \cfrac{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2}{s_p \cdot \sqrt{\tfrac{2}{n_g}}} 
$$

- $T_D$, the calculated test statistic of the data $D$

- $\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2$, the effect $\Delta$ as mean difference of group 1 and 2

- $s_p$, the pooled standard deviation

- $n_g$, the sample size of the balanced group 1 and 2

## The warp core of Fishers statistics

$$
T = \cfrac{\Delta \cdot n}{s}
$$

- explains almost all statistical challenges

- answers the question: "What are we actually modelling?"

- fuels almost all statistical inference in regression

## All in the same boat

Q: Why do so many colleges and grad schools teach p = 0.05?

A: Because that's still what the scientific community and journal editors use.

Q: Why do so many people still use p = 0.05?

A: Because that's what they were taught in college or grad school.

## Two schools of probability {.smaller}

. . .

**Probability as Frequency**

- What’s the probability a coin will land heads? 
- Depends on how often it lands heads --- the *frequency* of heads

. . .

**Probability as Belief**

- "humans are probably the main cause of our changing climate."
- "the probability the dinosaurs were wiped out by a meteor is."


. . . 

> *"Inside every non-Bayesian, there is a Bayesian struggling to get out." --- Dennis V. Lindley (quoted by E. T. Jaynes)*


## Bayes Theorem {.smaller}

*Suppose a hypothesis $H$ and some data $D$ as evidence*


$$
Pr(H|D) = \cfrac{Pr(D|H)\cdot Pr(H)}{Pr(D)}
$$

- $Pr(H|D)$ asks how probable is our explanation $H$ given our data $D$?  

- $Pr(D|H)$ corresponds to how well our hypothesis $H$ accounts for our data $D$.

- $Pr(H)$  corresponds to how well our hypothesis fits with other things we know.

- $Pr(D)$ corresponds to how surprising the data $D$ is.

## Barriers {.smaller}

> “Methods for robust statistics, a state of the art in the early 2000s, notably for robust regression and robust multivariate analysis.” --- robust: Port of the S+ “Robust Library”

- Users lack programming skills
- Users lack theoretical understanding
- Partners only use classic statistics that they have learnt
- Students need statistics that they can also use in other courses
- Bayesian statistics needs priors
- The $p$-value is accecpted and widespread

## Confidence interal vs. credible interval {.smaller}

> *"given the observed data, the effect has 95% probability of falling within this range"*

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
ki_tbl <- tibble(delta = 0,
                 arms = 1.5)

ggplot(ki_tbl) +
  aes(x = "2 - 1", y = delta) +
  theme_void() +
  geom_point(size = 10) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = delta - arms, ymax = delta + arms), 
                width = 0.1, size = 4) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-2, 2), breaks = seq(-1, 5, 1))  +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank()) 
```

> *"there is a 95% probability that when computing a confidence interval from data of this sort, the effect falls within this range"*

## Bayes factor

- Bayes factors are a ratio of the likelihood of $H_0$ over $H_1$

- If the ratio is 1, then $H_0$ and $H_1$ are equally likely

- If the Bayes factor is > 1, we have more evidence to support $H_0$

- If the Bayes factor is > 1, we have more evidence to support $H_1$

. . .

- Again, you might ask for a threshold  --- give me my $\alpha$! Okay, its 10...
