## Why methylation analysis?

- Methylation is a crucial epigenetic modification that **regulates** gene expression without altering the DNA sequence.

- Abnormal methylation patterns are associated with numerous **diseases**, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and neurological disorders.

-  In **cancer**, certain genes become abnormally methylated, leading to oncogene activation or tumor suppressor gene silencing.

## Why methylation analysis?

- Methylation plays a key in **development** by controlling the expression of genes critical for cell differentiation and organ formation. 

-  Methylation patterns change with **age** and in response to environmental factors, such as diet, toxins, and stress.

-  As methylation can be influenced by genetic and environmental factors, its analysis is essential for **personalized medicine**.

## Dutch famine of 1944–1945

- Food caloric intake for many Dutch people dropped to fewer than 1000 calories per day. 
- Provided strong evidence for the concept of "fetal programming". 
- Changes in methylation patterns have been implicated in subsequent health outcomes. 
- Findings suggest that severe malnutrition during critical periods of development can lead to epigenetic marks that persist throughout life.
