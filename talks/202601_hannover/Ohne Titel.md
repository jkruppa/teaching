After an intense semester at the Hochschule Osnabrück, I'm back on YouTube. After the mock exams, there are always mistakes in the questions that need correcting. All of my exam questions are available on YouTube. Sometimes the students find errors that are so severe that I will have to record some videos again. 

The first exam question covered the topic of the 'Breathing wall and the Haber–Bosch process'. The maths in the chemistry section was completely confusing. Therefore, a new video had to be made:

The next question was a total mess. I thought it would be a good idea to calculate the green land temperature using integrals. But that was too easy. The students corrected me during my lecture, and we improved the question. I had to rewrite the entire script

Most of my exams are available on YouTube. Some of the questions are a little outdated, but the students liked having the opportunity to revisit the most important part of my lectures: the exam questions.
